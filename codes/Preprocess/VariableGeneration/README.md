## VariableGeneration

The codes in this folder create MATLAB tables with the derived variables: average pupil diameter and pupil diameter difference, seperately. **Note**: data must be "cleaned" before computing these new variables. For more guidance of the data preprossing steps refer to the README in the **LightOcular** or **codes/Preprocess** directories.
