## Read

Codes in this directory read raw data files from the folder **raw**. It is important the directory structure is maintained for the codes to work out of the box. Trials must be read individually by manually updating codes. In **MinoltaDataRead2.m** the raw filename must be inserted into the code where indicated. In **TobiiDataRead.m** the trial number must be entered as a single digit where indicated.
