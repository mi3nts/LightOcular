## MergeRuns

The codes here merge the output from scripts in the **codes/Preprocess/MergeAndSync** folder. More precisely, the data tables from each run are concatentaed (stacked on top of each other) yielding a single table with data across all trials.

**Note**: Minolta_MergeRuns.m merges tables with only light data, while Minolta_Tobii_MergeRuns.m merges tables with both light and ocular data.
