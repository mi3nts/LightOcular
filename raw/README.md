## raw

The folders “Minolta” and “Tobii” contain raw data collected using the Konica Minolta CL-500A  Illuminance Spectrophotometer and Tobii Pro Glasses 2. Here, “raw” means data that has simply been written from the sensing device to a .csv (Minolta) or .json (Tobii) file. More information about these devices can be found at the links below. Data was collected on three separate days, labelled Run1, Run2, or Run3. **Note**: files must remain in this folder for the codes in **codes/Preprocess/Read** to work properly.
